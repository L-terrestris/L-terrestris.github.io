title: Dynamics Plan
---

# System Dynamics Draft

Identify and discuss the materials you plan to use in fabrication. Decide who will be obtaining those materials and distributing them.
 
Identify and Discuss the various parameters you plan to model in your simulation, including
actuator modeling
input signal specification
mass and inertia properties
link and/or joint stiffness
damping
friction
Discuss your plans for experimentally obtaining each of those values, and the model you would like to use for describing each phenomenon.

Identify and Discuss how you plan to prototype your system and assign one person to do that
 
 
Identify and Discuss how you plan to collect system-level motion or force data, including
method (IMU, video, discrete joint sensors, force/torque sensing)
data extraction approach

Identify and Discuss your plan for shared simulation tasks
which of you will be updating the code
adding model fitting routines
filtering, interpolating and otherwise massaging input data.

Finally, identify and discuss any reporting tasks that may be needed
compiling information into a report (may be combined with the simulation if using Jupyter)

Split each of these tasks to the individuals on your team, and come up with at least one deliverable for each person for the remainder of the week
 
The remaining tasks will be assigned to the group for next weekâ€™s assignment.
Prototype System/ material 
Motor and material of system

Spring Model:
Add known weight or water to measure spring stiffness for system
Base assumptions off of motor torque (weight), etc 

Beam model Experiment
FEA:
Measure and get young's modulus of cardstock or cardboard
Run Solidworks FEA on end plate that spring or cable attaches too

Motion study experiment:
Make it set up with a rubber band or spring and a string to pull on the system. 
Make markers of points of interest.
Perform motion study in tracker

Or should we do just the pendulum? 
A little confused on that

Actuator

Material info (density, stiffness, etc)

Prototyping 

Updating dynamics code
