# Project Title : How can foldable techniques translate a small number of actuators into motion for a robot traveling through small spaces?

## Introduction
The team's semester project begun around the general topic of _Navigating Tight Spaces with Foldable Robotics_.
Following the preliminary research, we settled on modelling a robot with bio-inspiration from the _Lumbricus Terrestris_ commonly known as the _Common Earthworm_.
Our robot seeks to utilize the least number of actuators possible to complete this task.
