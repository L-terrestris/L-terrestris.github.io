# Project Title : How can foldable techniques translate a small number of actuators into unique locomotion?

## Introduction
The team's semester project begun around the general topic of _Navigating Tight Spaces with Foldable Robotics_.\
The team was tasked with researching a more specific question through a semester-long course and following the preliminary research, we settled on modelling a robot with bio-inspiration from the _Lumbricus Terrestris_ commonly known as the _Common Earthworm_.\
However, After half the semester, we had a major project change. We have shifted from tight space navigation to locomotion, and seek to answer the following question:

“How can foldable techniques translate a small number of actuators into unique locomotion?”
