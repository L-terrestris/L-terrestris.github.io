# Develop a research question

## Description
>> **Instructions**
1. Starting with the research question selected for your team, work on adapting and refining it to fit your team’s specific goals and this year’s course constraints (with regard to makeability, feasibility, etc)
2. Defend your selected question by answering the questions below.

>> **Discussion**\
What is your research question?\
After describing your research question, explain your rationale for why it is a good question to ask by answering the following questions. For each numbered answer provide at least one paragraph per response.\
Tractability: Is your question tractable and achievable? Discuss your plan for scoping your problem to fit in a 15-week course. (>1 paragraph)
How have you focused or constrained the problem to differentiate yourself and/or become more tractable?
Examples include looking at one specific type of motion, using a specific animal as a source of inspiration (for generating unique specifications), or limiting yourself to a particular set of materials, parts, cost requirements, etc.\
Novelty: Is your question novel? How have you established novelty?
What keywords did you use when performing a literature review on your topic?
What were the four most highly cited references? (Consider using Mendeley or similar to format your citations according to the “Submission Best Practices” document)
Provide a short summary of each, focusing on whether these papers have already done what you set out to do.
Interesting:
Is your question interesting, timely, and relevant?
What makes it important to others?
Why is this idea important now? What prevented it from being answered 10 years ago?
Within what contexts could other people use your results?
What are the potential broader impacts on society?

Open-Ended: Is your question open-ended? Could it leave room for a deeper look if given more time and resources? Discuss how you have structured your research question to permit further, deeper investigation.

Modular: Is your question modular? How does it fit with other complementary research thrusts?

Team Fit: How does answering this question leverage your interests and abilities?
T
opic Fit: How does the question use foldable robotics techniques to answer it?
