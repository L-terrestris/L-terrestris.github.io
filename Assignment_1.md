### Introduction
Team 5 was given the general topic of “Navigating Tight Spaces with Foldable Robotics” and was tasked with researching a more specific question through a semester-long course. After some initial research and consideration of criteria that have to be met, the team has decided to answer the following question:

_How can foldable techniques translate a small number of actuators into motion for a robot traveling through small spaces?_

This paper will explain the aforementioned criteria and detail the thought process that was followed to meet those criteria with a more specific research question.

### Tractability
The team has come across many ideas that would have been interesting to explore. However, due to the nature of the class for which this project will be carried out, there exist some constraints that will need to be met in order to make the project tractable/achievable. The main elements affecting the project scope are time and budget. Considering that the class mentioned above is a semester-long project class, the total time available to the team is about 15 weeks. With this in mind, the complexity we aim for will be kept to a minimum. Since this is a class environment, all of the team members are still learning. As such, keeping the scope of the project slim will ensure that we do not bite off more than we can chew in the allotted time. To further save time, the team will draw inspiration from already existing sources, particularly the motion of worms and previous projects with aims similar to our own. The last major way the team will attempt to cut down on time is through the choice of materials. Due to the nature of foldable techniques, structural components can be created with easily attainable materials such as paper, cardboard, or similar. Functional components also need to be considered. By minimizing the use of actuators, the team will be able to spend less time waiting for ordered parts and spend more time prototyping.

Both of the previous considerations also serve to keep the budget down to a minimum. Paper-like materials are inexpensive and easily found practically anywhere, and cutting down on actuators saves even more funds. Additionally, the team can make use of rapid prototyping techniques, particularly 3D printing and laser cutting, to achieve designs in a quick yet inexpensive way. The combination of all these constraints will allow for the completion of the project within the 15-week semester.
### Novelty
Our question builds off of previous research projects that focus on worm-like designs to establish motion. The bio inspired design is a modular subject that has uses in fields of research pertaining to search and rescue, medical, motion analysis, and in general soft robotics. To establish novelty, team 5 will focus on generating motion through a single actuator, out of a foldable based robot crafted from cheap and easily accessible supplies. When searching for previous research, emphasis was placed on the following key words: Worm inspired, single actuator robot, origami inspired, peristaltic motion. 
There exists extensive research exploring bioinspired worm robots, all ranging from varying levels of complexity. To start, research in the field of origami based worm-like robots has seen a lot of prevalence, especially using an accordion shape. The paper by C D Onal eta al [1] on ‘An Origami inspired approach to Worm robots’ (158 Citations) focuses on the fast design and fabrication of origami inspired robots. They mention the actuator type must be compact and powerful and mostly focus on small DC motors, springs, and thermal based motion before describing the importance of peristaltic motion, and concluding on a handful of origami based designs. A single actuator origami inspired worm robot can be seen in Banerjee et al [2] with ‘Single-Motor Controlled Tendon-Driven Peristaltic Soft Origami Robot’ (14 citations). This example focuses on the use of a single servo motor and a system of springs to drive peristaltic motion. They use both 3D printed parts and folded paper, though they emphasize that future work on examining the dynamics, support, and strength of the design is needed. 
A more complex example of a worm-like robot, driven by a single actuator to achieve peristaltic motion, is mentioned by B Winstone et al [3] in ‘Single motor actuated peristaltic wave generator for a soft bodied worm robot’ (9 citations). The paper details a complex soft robot that steers away from origami inspired to focus on single actuator motion. Using a tendon, three segments, and a series of gear boxes, they effectively show the robot moving on a flat surface, through a tight space, and pulling a load. They achieved single actuated peristaltic motion which is concluded to lower the design complexity and cost.
Inch worm inspired robots that use an omega shape to move are another prevalent field mentioned by J. Koh et al [4] in ‘Omegabot : Biomimetic inchworm robot using SMA coil actuator and smart composite microstructures (SCM)’ (47 citations). This example uses a single shape memory actuator and is designed to reach small spaces other robots can’t. Another inchworm inspired robot in Tang et al [5] (13 citations) focuses mostly on having both a small weight and a very cheap cost. They achieved an easily manufactured design with a silicone tube, and hot glued paper clips for feet. 
Lastly, it is worth mentioning a different motion type as seen in Zarrouk et al [6] (20 citations) with the SAW robot. This paper uses a single motor to develop a wave like motion (specifically a sine wave) and reports an optimized version that can move faster and climb between two walls. 
The six examples we discuss are all relevant to the project as they elaborate on research of worm inspired robots, single actuators, and origami based designs. We group the papers by their research finding rather than their citations for clarity. Between the papers, we are interested in the type of motion, being wave and peristaltic, fast fabrication, and low cost materials. Separately the papers each highlight one aspect of these common issues, but Team 5 proposes to make a worm inspired robot, capable of motion driven by a single actuator, developed out of cheap materials such as paper and elastic bands, with the ability to rapidly fabricate prototypes. 

### Interesting
Some of the goals for the projects in this class include concepts that are interesting, timely, and relevant. Part of what Team 5 believes will be the most important effect of our project on others is the application of our concepts to other robots. Developing techniques to minimize actuator usage is something that can reduce costs for any actuated robot, especially considering that actuators are one of the primary components. Another area that could be improved is that of soft robotics; the origami-inspired techniques used in foldable robotics have potential to be applied in a field where soft/compliant materials are used. One of the potential expansion paths from this project, which will be discussed in more detail in a later section, is the use of cheap and biodegradable materials. If it becomes viable to create small robots that are quick and inexpensive to manufacture and leave a small footprint in nature, then this project could be relevant to fields like exploration or search/rescue. The scaling of such a project could positively impact these fields by reducing the manpower needed to accomplish these tasks and, in turn, providing a safer alternative.

### Open-Ended
Our question is very much so open ended, as it leaves a lot of room for improvements and could be adapted in various areas of study. Our research question, as it stands, focuses on creating motion with a minimal amount of actuators to navigate through tight spaces. One potential area that could be further looked into past the scope of this project is how reducing the amount of actuators affects the entire system. When reducing the amount of actuators, each actuator then becomes responsible for more than just one simple way of motion, so looking into how the system gets affected could be worth researching. Another direction that our research question could be taken is adapting our project in the field of soft-robot technology. Soft robotics is an ever growing field that takes inspirations from various fields and areas of engineering, so our research question could prove to be beneficial to soft-robot technology. Lastly, the most relevant area where our research question could be expanded is with several different areas of study where there is a need to navigate through small, hard-to-reach spaces with accuracy. Our question is broad enough to where areas such as medical, mining, rescue, etc. could benefit from our research.  
### Modular
Our research focus adds on to over a decade of work being conducted in the area of miniature robots with reduced number of actuation that can perform some specific tasks such as data acquisition in petroleum reservoirs, or navigating rough terrains. Our research seeks to build upon and contribute to this broader research thrust of promoting single-actuation of bio-inspired miniature robots. Locomotion of such robots is one step in reaching the goal of having robots navigate through areas that humans cannot get to due to size and danger - from oil exploration to complex medical surgeries. In the long run, such low-cost robots could, for instance, be fitted with cameras for taking pictures of these spaces or, in the case of surgery could be used in drug delivery or even controlled venous surgery (such as declogging cholesterol from arteries). Our research hence presents one module of the overarching goal of having tiny robots perform tasks that human beings may be unable to perform.
### Team Fit
Generally, the team consists of members with an interest and some experience in the kinematics and control of robots. This comes in very handy given that our research focuses heavily on locomotion in miniature sized robots. In addition a number of the members on the team have experience with prototyping skills from Computer Aided Designing, to 3D printing and laser cutting. This wide range of rapid prototyping skills give us the advantage of being able to physically model our robot within the time frame of the academic semester. Members of the team also have considerable experience in scripting languages such as MATLAB and Python as well as a substantial skillset in electronics. These meet the need to script any commands as well as build and power our robot. 
Being graduate students, the team members have experience with conducting research and will be able to leverage said research skills into learning about and completing our given research project. 

### Topic Fit
Our research question has the potential to use multiple aspects of foldable robotics techniques to answer it. One of the foldable robotic techniques that would be used to answer our research question is that of using folding techniques to create or improve motion. As seen in the pop-up book assignment, there are a plethora of folding techniques, and many of them can be used to create unique motions. The combination of folding techniques paired with an actuator to create motion fits perfectly within the scope of the class. Not only can the folding techniques be used to create motion, but the folding techniques could also be used for the structural component of our project. Lastly, we want to show that we can optimize the movement of our robot through the use of only one actuator, so we will need to rely heavily on folding techniques to carry out the motion for the actuator.
